- Set the extension to open once time for a task is up
- Fixed a bug with minutes selected option, where it would overflow the 59-minutes limit.
- Couldn't get it to open in a natural way (as a usual extension), so I set it to open as a window, which looked more convenient and closer to reality than a new tab.
- Fully implemented the Notification API, and the app is now sending notifications as expected.

-- REMAINING -- (Additional features)
- Add an alarm-like sound when a task is up.
