- Removed attribute "onclick='removeTask(this.parentNode.parentNode)'" from removeButton elements and replaced it with event listener, chrome was having a problem with in-line scripts
- background.ts and its JS file for the periodic check-up
- Added the background file in manifest.json
- Changed some CSS to look better in the chrome extension format 
- Changed to using the Notification API, it is more suitable in this case than alert()
