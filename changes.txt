- Used background.js as a service worker, a background script that verifies the deadlines each second.
- Used varius APIs I searched, such as Chrome API, WebWorker API, ...etc
- Background checking is fine, it deletes the task quietly when in background, and shows the appropriate effects when extension pop-up is opened
- Finished setting up all the styles needed in the extension mode
- Due to using chrome.storage and entirely ditching localStorage, the app will ONLY work in extension mode
- Used Chrome.storage.sync instead of local, so tasks will be synced accross many devices if user has enabled synchronisation

-- REMAINING
- Need to set up Notification API in pup-up mode, and look for another way in background mode
